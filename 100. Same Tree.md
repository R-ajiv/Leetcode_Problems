# Same Tree

## Intuition
The problem asks us to determine whether two binary trees are the same or not. Our intuition here is to traverse both trees simultaneously and compare corresponding nodes to check for equality.

## Approach
We can solve this problem recursively. We'll start by checking if both current nodes are `NULL`. If they are, we consider them equal. If only one of them is `NULL`, they are not the same. Then, we compare the values of the current nodes. If the values are not equal, the trees are not the same. Finally, we make recursive calls for both left and right subtrees.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (recursive call stack).

# Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == NULL && q == NULL) {
            return true;
        }
        if (p == NULL || q == NULL) {
            return false;
        }
        if (p->val != q->val) {
            return false;
        }
        return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};
