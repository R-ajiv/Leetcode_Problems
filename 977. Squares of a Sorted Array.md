# Intuition
The problem requires us to square each element in the given array and return a new array containing these squares in non-decreasing order.

# Approach
To solve the problem, we can start by creating a new array to store the squares of the elements in the input array. Then, we can sort this new array to obtain the squares in non-decreasing order.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This complexity arises from sorting the array of squared elements.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. We use additional space to store the squared elements.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans(nums.size()); // Create a vector to store the squared elements
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Square each element and store it in the 'ans' vector
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[i] * nums[i];
        }
        
        // Sort the vector in non-decreasing order
        sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        
        return ans; // Return the sorted array of squared elements
    }
};
