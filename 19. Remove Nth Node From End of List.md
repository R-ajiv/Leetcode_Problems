# Intuition
To remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We maintain two pointers, one moving N steps ahead of the other. When the first pointer reaches the end of the list, the second pointer will be at the Nth node from the end.

# Approach
1. Start with two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. Move the first pointer (`p1`) N steps ahead.
3. Move both pointers simultaneously until the first pointer reaches the end of the list.
4. The second pointer (`p2`) will be at the Nth node from the end.
5. Update the next pointer of the node before `p2` to skip the Nth node.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using constant extra space.
