# Custom Sort String

## Intuition
My initial thoughts on solving this problem were to create a frequency map for the given order string. Then, iterate through the input string and separate characters based on whether they are present in the order or not.

## Approach
I started by creating a frequency map (`m`) for the characters in the order string. Then, I iterated through the input string (`s`) and categorized characters into two strings: `s1` for characters in the order and `s2` for characters not in the order.

Finally, I reconstructed the sorted string by iterating through the order string and appending characters from `s1` based on their frequency in the order.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- Space complexity: O(n), considering the space used for the frequency map and the two separate strings.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        string s1 = "" ;
        string s2 = "" ;
        map < char , int > m ;

        for ( int i = 0 ; i < order.length() ; i++ ) {
            m[order[i]]++ ;
        }

        for ( int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++ ) {
            if ( m[s[i]] != 0 )
                m[s[i]]++ ;
            else
                s2 += s[i] ;
        }

        for ( int i = 0 ; i < order.length() ; i++ ) {
            while (m[order[i]] > 1 ) {
                s1 += order[i] ;
                m[order[i]]-- ;
            }
        }

        return s1 + s2 ; 
    }
};
