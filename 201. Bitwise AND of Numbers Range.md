# Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to find the common prefix among all the binary representations of the numbers within the given range.

# Approach
The approach involves finding the common leftmost bits between the given range of numbers. We iterate from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, continuously right-shifting both `left` and `right` until they become equal. At each step, we count how many times we perform the right shift, which gives us the number of bits we can shift back to the left to get the final result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the maximum value between `left` and `right`.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0; 
        while(left != right) {
            left = left / 2;
            right = right / 2;
            count++;
        }
        return left << count;
    }
};
