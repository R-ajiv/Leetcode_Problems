# Minimum Common Value

## Intuition
My first thought to solve this problem is to use two pointers, one for each array, and iterate through both arrays to find the minimum common value. This is because the arrays are sorted, and we can take advantage of this property.

## Approach
I'm using two pointers, `i` for the first array (`nums1`) and `j` for the second array (`nums2`). I iterate through both arrays, comparing elements at the current positions of the pointers. If the element in `nums1` is less than the element in `nums2`, I move the `i` pointer to the next element in `nums1`. If it's greater, I move the `j` pointer to the next element in `nums2`. If the elements are equal, I check if it's the minimum common value encountered so far. If it is, or if it's the first common value found, I update the `min` variable. I then move both pointers to the next elements.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both arrays. We iterate through both arrays once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getCommon(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int min = -1;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                if (min == -1 || nums1[i] < min) {
                    min = nums1[i];
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
};
