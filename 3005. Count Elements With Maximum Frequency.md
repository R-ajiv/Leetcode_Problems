# Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

## Intuition
My initial thought to solve this problem is to iterate through the given array, count the frequency of each element, and keep track of the maximum frequency encountered. Finally, count the elements with the maximum frequency.

## Approach
1. Sort the given array to make it easier to count frequencies.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and count the frequency of each element.
3. Keep track of the maximum frequency encountered.
4. Count the elements with the maximum frequency.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
  - The nested loop for counting frequencies contributes to the quadratic time complexity.
- Space complexity: $O(n)$
  - Additional space is used to store the frequency count for each element.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxFreq = 0, ans = 0;
        vector<int> freqCount;

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int count = 1;

            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                if (nums[j] == nums[i]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }

            if (count > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = count;
            }

            freqCount.push_back(count);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < freqCount.size(); i++) {
            if (freqCount[i] == maxFreq) {
                ans += freqCount[i];
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
