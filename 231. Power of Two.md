# Power of Two

## Intuition
My initial thoughts on solving this problem were to check if the given number is a power of two. I considered that powers of two have a distinct binary representation, which could be a key to solving the problem.

## Approach
To determine if a number is a power of two, I checked two conditions:
1. The number should be greater than 0 (since negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of two).
2. Using bitwise AND (`&`) with the number and its decremented value (`n - 1`). This is based on the fact that powers of two have only one '1' bit in their binary representation. Therefore, if we subtract 1 from a power of two, all bits will be flipped, and the result will have all '1' bits. The bitwise AND with the original number should yield 0 for a power of two.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(1)
  - The bitwise operations and comparisons are constant time operations.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
};
