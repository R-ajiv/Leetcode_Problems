# Intuition
My first thought on solving this problem is to utilize the property of the given array, where all elements are within a specific range. This property allows us to devise a simple and efficient solution.

# Approach
The approach I took involves sorting the given array. Once the array is sorted, all duplicate elements will be adjacent to each other. Hence, by iterating through the sorted array, we can easily identify and collect the duplicate elements. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. Traversing the sorted array to find duplicates takes linear time O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

- Space complexity:
The space complexity primarily depends on the additional space used for storing the output vector, which can hold at most n/2 elements (in the worst case, when every element is a duplicate). Hence, the space complexity is O(n).

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>ans;

        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());

        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i-1]==nums[i]){
                ans.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
