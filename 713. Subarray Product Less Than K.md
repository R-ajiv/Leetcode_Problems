# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can utilize a sliding window approach. We'll maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the left and right boundaries of the subarray respectively. We'll also keep track of the product of elements within the current subarray. As we move the `right` pointer forward, we continuously update the product. If the product exceeds the given value `k`, we adjust the window by moving the `left` pointer forward until the product becomes less than `k` again. With each valid subarray found, we update the count accordingly.

# Approach
1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to 0.
2. Initialize `product` as 1 and `count` as 0.
3. Iterate through the array using `right` pointer.
4. Update `product` by multiplying with the current element.
5. If `product` exceeds or equals `k`, move the `left` pointer forward until `product` becomes less than `k`. Update `count` as subarrays ending at `right` - subarrays ending at `left` + 1.
6. Increment `right`.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until `right` reaches the end of the array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1), constant space is used.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int left = 0, right = 0, product = 1, count = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    if(k <= 1) return 0;
    while (right < n) {
      product *= nums[right];
      while (product >= k) product /= nums[left++];
      count += 1 + (right - left);
      right++;
    }
    return count;
  }
};
