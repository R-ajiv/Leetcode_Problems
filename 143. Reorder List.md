# Intuition
To reorder the given linked list, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the middle of the list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternatively.

# Approach
We start by finding the middle of the linked list using two pointers: slow and fast. Once we have the middle node, we reverse the second half of the list. After that, we merge the first half of the list with the reversed second half by adjusting the next pointers.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice, once to find the middle and once to reverse the second half.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

# Code
```java

 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }

            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
