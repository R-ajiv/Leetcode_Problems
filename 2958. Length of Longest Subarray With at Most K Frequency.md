# Intuition
To find the length of the longest subarray with at most k distinct elements, we can utilize a sliding window approach. We maintain a map to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window. As we move the window, we adjust the map accordingly, and if the frequency of any element exceeds k, we shrink the window from the left side.

# Approach
We initialize variables for the left and right pointers of the window and an empty unordered map to store the frequency of elements. We iterate through the array using the right pointer. We increment the frequency of the current element and check if the frequency exceeds k. If it does, we move the left pointer until the frequency becomes valid again. During this process, we update the answer with the maximum length of the valid subarray encountered so far.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the unordered map to store the frequency of elements.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            mp[nums[r]]++;
            if (mp[nums[r]] > k) {
                while (nums[l] != nums[r]) {
                    mp[nums[l]]--;
                    l++;
                }
                mp[nums[l]]--;
                l++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
