# Binary Subarrays With Sum

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can utilize the sliding window technique. We iterate through the array while maintaining two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the left and right boundaries of the current subarray. We also maintain a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of elements within the current subarray. As we traverse the array, we adjust the boundaries of the window based on the sum of elements. We increment the `right` pointer to expand the window until the sum becomes greater than the goal. Then, we increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window while updating the sum accordingly. At each step, we update the count of subarrays that satisfy the given sum condition.

# Approach
1. Initialize variables `left`, `right`, `sum`, and `ans` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array using a while loop with the `right` pointer.
3. Add the current element to the `sum`.
4. While the `sum` exceeds the goal and `left` pointer is not greater than `right`, subtract the element at `left` from the `sum` and increment `left`.
5. If the `sum` is less than or equal to the goal, update `ans` by adding the count of subarrays from `left` to `right`.
6. Increment `right`.
7. Return `ans`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

class Solution {

    public int res(int nums[],int n)
    {
        int len=nums.length;
        int left=0;
        int right=0;
        int sum=0;
        int ans=0;

       while(right<len)
       {
           sum+=nums[right];
           while(sum>n && left<=right)
           {
               sum-=nums[left];
               left++;
           }

           if(sum<=n)
           {
               ans+=right-left+1;
           }
         right++;
       }
    return ans;
    }


    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {

    return res(nums,goal)-res(nums,goal-1);
      
    }
