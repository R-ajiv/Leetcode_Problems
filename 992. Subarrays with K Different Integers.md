# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can utilize a sliding window approach. We'll maintain two pointers, `i` and `j`, representing the left and right boundaries of our window respectively. We'll use a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window. By expanding the window to the right while keeping track of the number of distinct elements within the window, we can count the subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers.

# Approach
1. Initialize pointers `i` and `j` to 0.
2. Initialize an empty hashmap `mp` to store the frequency of elements within the window.
3. Initialize a variable `c` to count the subarrays.
4. Iterate `j` over the array:
   - Increment the frequency of `nums[j]` in `mp`.
   - While the number of distinct elements in `mp` exceeds `k`, increment `i` and update `mp`.
   - Update `c` by adding the length of the current subarray from `i` to `j`.
5. Return the count `c`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array `nums`.

public:
    
    int countSubarraysWithAtMostKDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k){
        int n=nums.size();
        
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        
        int i=0, j=0;
        
        int c=0;
        
        while(j<n){
            mp[nums[j]]++;
            
            while(i<=j && mp.size()>k){
                if(--mp[nums[i]] == 0) mp.erase(nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
            
            c += (j-i+1);
            
            j++;
        }
        
        return c;
    }
    
    int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        return countSubarraysWithAtMostKDistinct(nums,k)-countSubarraysWithAtMostKDistinct(nums,k-1);
    }
};
