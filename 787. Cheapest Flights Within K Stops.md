# Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the cheapest flight cost from source to destination within a certain number of stops. We need to explore various paths but restrict the search based on the number of stops allowed.

# Approach
We can approach this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm with a modification to track the number of stops. We create an adjacency list to represent the graph where each node contains the destination node and the cost associated with the flight. We use a priority queue to explore the nodes efficiently.

Starting from the source, we traverse through the graph while keeping track of the current cost and the number of stops. We only proceed to the next node if the number of stops is within the limit. We update the cost if we find a cheaper path. We continue this process until we reach the destination or exhaust all possible paths within the stop limit.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E * log V), where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges.
- Space complexity: O(V), where V represents the number of vertices.

public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        vector<pair<int,int>>adj[n];
        for(auto it : flights) {
            adj[it[0]].push_back({it[1],it[2]});
        }
        queue<pair<int,pair<int,int>>>q;
        q.push({0,{src,0}});
        vector<int>dist(n,1e9);
        dist[src]=0;
        while(!q.empty()){
            auto it=q.front();
            q.pop();
            int stops=it.first;
            int node=it.second.first;
            int cost=it.second.second;


            if(stops>k)continue;
            for(auto iter:adj[node]){
                int adjNode=iter.first;
                int edW=iter.second;

                if(cost+edW < dist[adjNode] && stops<=k){
                    dist[adjNode]=cost + edW;
                    q.push({stops+1,{adjNode,cost+edW}});
                }
            }
        }
        if(dist[dst]==1e9) return -1;
        return dist[dst];
    }
