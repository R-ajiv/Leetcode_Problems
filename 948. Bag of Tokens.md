# Intuition
The problem involves optimizing the score by using tokens wisely within the given power constraints. Sorting the tokens allows for an efficient strategy to maximize the score.

# Approach
1. Sort the tokens in ascending order.
2. Initialize two pointers, i and j, at the start and end of the tokens array, respectively.
3. Initialize variables ans and score to track the maximum score.
4. Iterate while i is less than or equal to j:
    - If the current power is sufficient to use the token at index i:
        - Consume the token, decrement power, increment score, and move i to the next token.
        - Update ans with the maximum score.
    - If the current score is greater than 0 and using the token at index j would not exceed the power limit:
        - Reclaim power by using the token at index j, decrement score, and move j to the previous token.
    - If neither of the above conditions is met, break the loop.
5. Return the maximum score (ans).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of tokens.
- Space complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int power) {

        sort(tokens.begin(),tokens.end()); 
        int n = tokens.size();          
        int ans = 0;                     
        int i = 0, j = n-1;            
        int score = 0;                

        while(i <= j){                  
            if(power >= tokens[i]){     
                power -= tokens[i];     
                score++;                
                i++;                  
                ans = max(ans,score);
            }
            else if(score > 0){         
                power += tokens[j];    
                score--;                
                j--;                    
            }
            else{
                break;                 
            }
        }
        return ans;                     
    }
};
