# Find the Town Judge

## Intuition
The problem involves identifying a town judge based on trust relationships between the town residents. The judge is someone who is trusted by everyone else but does not trust anyone.

## Approach
To solve this problem, we can maintain an array called `trustScores` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the number of residents in the town. We iterate through the given trust relationships and update the scores in the array. For each trust relation [a, b], we decrement the score of a and increment the score of b. The judge, if exists, will have a trust score of `n-1` as everyone else trusts the judge, and the judge trusts no one.

After updating the trust scores, we iterate through the array to find a person with a trust score of `n-1`, which indicates the potential judge. If found, we return the person's index; otherwise, we return -1.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(E), where E is the number of trust relationships.
- Space complexity: O(N), where N is the number of residents in the town.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] trustScores = new int[n+1];
        for(int[] relation : trust){
            trustScores[relation[0]]--;
            trustScores[relation[1]]++;
        }
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            if(trustScores[i] == n-1){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
