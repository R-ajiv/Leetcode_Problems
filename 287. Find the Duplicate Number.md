# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm. It works by finding the intersection point of two pointers moving at different speeds in a cyclic linked list. In our case, we treat the array as a linked list where the value at each index points to the next index.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the first element of the array.
2. Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time until they meet at some point inside the cycle.
3. Reset one pointer (say `fast`) to the start of the array, and keep the other pointer (say `slow`) at the meeting point.
4. Move both pointers at the same pace (one step at a time) until they meet again. The meeting point will be the duplicate number.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses only constant extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[0];

        // Find the intersection point of the two pointers
        do {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        } while (slow != fast);

        // Reset one pointer to the start and move both pointers until they meet again
        slow = nums[0];
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }

        return slow; // or fast (they meet at the same point)
    }
};
