# Intersection  of Two Arrays

# Intuition
My first thoughts on solving the Intersection of Two Arrays problem were to sort both arrays and then use two pointers to iterate through them. By comparing the elements at the pointers, I could identify the common elements and add them to the result.

# Approach
I took the following approach to solve the problem:
1. Sort both input arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, pointing to the beginning of each array.
3. Iterate through both arrays while comparing elements at the pointers.
4. If the element at `nums1[i]` is less than the element at `nums2[j]`, increment `i`.
5. If the element at `nums1[i]` is greater than the element at `nums2[j]`, increment `j`.
6. If the elements are equal, check if the result vector is empty or if the current element is not the same as the last element in the result vector. If true, add the element to the result vector.
7. Increment both pointers.
8. Continue until reaching the end of either array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * log(n)) where n is the maximum size of the input arrays due to the sorting step.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the extra space used is constant.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersection(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        vector<int> ans;
        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
        int i = 0; int j = 0;

        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                if (ans.empty() || nums1[i] != ans.back()) {
                    ans.push_back(nums1[i]);
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
