# Intuition
The problem asks to count the number of subarrays where the minimum element in the subarray is at least minK and the maximum element is at most maxK. We need to devise an efficient approach to count such subarrays.

# Approach
We can iterate through the array and maintain three indices: minKIndex, maxKIndex, and culpritIndex. 
- minKIndex keeps track of the most recent index where the element is equal to minK.
- maxKIndex keeps track of the most recent index where the element is equal to maxK.
- culpritIndex keeps track of the most recent index where an element is found that is either less than minK or greater than maxK.

For each element in the array:
1. If the current element is less than minK or greater than maxK, update culpritIndex.
2. If the current element is equal to minK, update minKIndex.
3. If the current element is equal to maxK, update maxKIndex.
4. Calculate the distance between minKIndex (or maxKIndex) and culpritIndex, indicating the number of subarrays ending at the current element that satisfy the condition. Add this count to the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    typedef long long ll;
    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int minK, int maxK) {
        int n = nums.size();
        ll result = 0;
        int minKIndex = -1;  
        int maxKIndex = -1;  
        int culpritIndex = -1; 

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < minK || nums[i] > maxK) {
                culpritIndex = i;  
            }

            if (nums[i] == minK) {
                minKIndex = i;     
            }

            if (nums[i] == maxK) {
                maxKIndex = i;     
            }

            ll smaller = min(minKIndex, maxKIndex);  
            ll temp = smaller - culpritIndex;        

            result += temp <= 0 ? 0 : temp;          
        }
        return result;
    }
};
