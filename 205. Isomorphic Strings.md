# Intuition
The problem asks us to determine whether two given strings are isomorphic or not. Isomorphic strings are those where characters in one string can be replaced to get the second string. My initial thought is to iterate through both strings and check if the mappings of characters from one string to the other remain consistent.

# Approach
We'll iterate through each character of both strings simultaneously. For each character pair (s[i], t[i]), we'll check if there is a consistent mapping between them. If we find any inconsistency in the mapping, we return false. Otherwise, we return true.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input strings. We have nested loops iterating over the strings.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we're not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        if(s.length()!=t.length())
        {
            return false;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            char x=s[i];
            char y=t[i];

            for(int j=0;j<s.length();j++){
                if(s[j]==x && t[j]!=y)
                {
                    return false;
                }
                if(t[j]==y && s[j]!=x)
                {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
