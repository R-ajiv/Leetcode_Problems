# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the CPU idle time by scheduling the tasks efficiently. The idea is to first determine the frequency of each task. Then, we can sort the tasks based on their frequency. By doing this, we ensure that the most frequent tasks are scheduled first, allowing for more idle time between them. We can calculate the idle time by finding the maximum frequency task and subtracting one (as we don't need idle time after the last occurrence of the most frequent task) and multiplying it by the given cooldown time. Then, we iterate through the remaining tasks and subtract their frequencies from the idle time.

# Approach
1. Initialize an array to store the frequency of each task.
2. Iterate through the tasks and update the frequency array.
3. Sort the frequency array to get the most frequent tasks at the end.
4. Calculate the maximum number of chunks by subtracting 1 from the frequency of the most frequent task.
5. Calculate the total idle time by multiplying the maximum chunk size with the cooldown time.
6. Iterate through the remaining tasks and update the idle time by subtracting the minimum of the current task frequency and the chunk size.
7. If idle time becomes negative, return the total number of tasks, else return the total tasks plus idle time.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of tasks. This is because of the sorting operation.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        int freq[26] = {0};
        for(char task : tasks){
            freq[task - 'A']++;
        }
        sort(begin(freq), end(freq));
        int chunk = freq[25] - 1;
        int idle = chunk * n;

        for(int i = 24; i >= 0; i--){
            idle -= min(chunk, freq[i]);
        }

        return idle < 0 ? tasks.size() : tasks.size() + idle;
    }
};
