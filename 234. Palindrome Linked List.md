# Intuition
To determine if a linked list is a palindrome, we can use the concept of reversing the second half of the list and comparing it with the first half. 

# Approach
We'll start by initializing two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both pointing to the head of the linked list. The `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle of the list. 

Then, we reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the `slow` pointer.

After that, we iterate through both the original list and the reversed second half list simultaneously, comparing each node's value. If at any point we find a mismatch, we return false, indicating that the list is not a palindrome. If the iteration completes without any mismatches, we return true, indicating that the list is a palindrome.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1), since we are not using any extra space apart from a few pointers.

    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {

        ListNode slow = head;
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        ListNode reversedSecondHalf = reverse(slow);

        while(head != null && reversedSecondHalf != null){
            if(head.val != reversedSecondHalf.val){
                return false;
            }
            head = head.next;
            reversedSecondHalf = reversedSecondHalf.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    ListNode reverse(ListNode s){
        ListNode prev = null, current = s, nextNode = s.next;
        
        while(current != null){
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = nextNode;
            
            if(nextNode != null) nextNode = nextNode.next;
