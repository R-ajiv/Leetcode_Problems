# Diameter of Binary Tree

# Intuition
My initial thought to solve this problem is to find the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the binary tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# Approach
I approached the problem using a recursive method. I defined a function to calculate the height of a subtree, and for each node, I recursively calculated the height of its left and right subtrees. The diameter of the tree is the maximum of the lengths of these subtrees. I updated the global maximum diameter as I traversed the tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. The space complexity is determined by the recursive call stack.

# Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

            return 0;

        int left = height(root->left);
        int right = height(root->right);

        return max(left, right) + 1;
    }

public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return 0;

        int x = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->left);
        int y = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->right);
        int z = height(root->left) + height(root->right);

        return max(max(x, y), z);
    }
