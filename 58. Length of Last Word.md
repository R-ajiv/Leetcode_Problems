# Intuition
We are tasked with finding the length of the last word in a given string. An intuitive approach would be to start from the end of the string and count characters until we encounter a space or reach the beginning of the string.

# Approach
1. Start from the end of the string.
2. Skip any trailing spaces.
3. Count characters until a space is encountered or we reach the beginning of the string.
4. Return the count as the length of the last word.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - We iterate through the string once, where n is the length of the string.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int length = 0;
        int i = s.size() - 1;
        // Skip any trailing spaces
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') {
            i--;
        }
        // Count characters until a space is encountered or beginning of the string
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] != ' ') {
            length++;
            i--;
        }
        return length;
    }
};
