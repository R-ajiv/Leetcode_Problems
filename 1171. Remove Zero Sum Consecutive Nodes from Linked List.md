# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the linked list and maintain a running sum of the nodes encountered so far. If the sum becomes zero at any point, it means that the nodes from the beginning up to the current node sum to zero. We can remove those nodes from the list.

# Approach
1. We'll iterate through the linked list using a pointer `a`.
2. At each iteration, we'll maintain a running sum of nodes starting from the current node.
3. If the sum becomes zero, it implies that the nodes from the start up to the current node sum to zero. We'll skip those nodes by adjusting the `next` pointers accordingly.
4. We'll continue this process until we reach the end of the list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2) - In the worst case, we may have to iterate through the entire list for each node to compute the sum.
- Space complexity: O(1) - We are using constant space apart from the input and output.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

        ans.next = head; // Point dummy node to the head of the list.
        ListNode a = ans; // Pointer for traversal.

        // Traverse through the list.
        while (a != null) {
            ListNode curr = a.next; // Pointer to current node.
            int sum = 0; // Initialize sum to zero.

            // Iterate through the remaining nodes.
            while (curr != null) {
                sum += curr.val; // Update sum with the value of current node.
                if (sum == 0) {
                    // If sum becomes zero, skip nodes from a to curr.
                    a.next = curr.next;
                }
                curr = curr.next; // Move to the next node.
            }
            a = a.next; // Move to the next node for traversal.
        }
        return ans.next; // Return the modified list.
