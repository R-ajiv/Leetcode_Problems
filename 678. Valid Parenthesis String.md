# Intuition
The problem requires determining whether a given string of parentheses and asterisks is valid or not. We need to come up with an approach that can handle different combinations of opening and closing parentheses along with asterisks.

# Approach
To solve this problem, we iterate through the string twice. In the first pass, we treat asterisks as open parentheses. We increment a counter for each open parenthesis encountered and decrement it for each closing parenthesis. If the counter goes negative at any point, it implies there are more closing parentheses than the available open parentheses or asterisks, making the string invalid.

After the first pass, if the counter is not negative, it indicates that there are enough open parentheses or asterisks to balance the closing parentheses. In the second pass, we treat asterisks as closing parentheses. We follow a similar approach, incrementing a counter for each closing parenthesis or asterisk and decrementing it for each open parenthesis. If at any point this counter becomes negative, it means there are more open parentheses than the available closing parentheses or asterisks, making the string invalid.

If both passes complete without encountering negative counters, it means the string is valid.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We traverse the string twice.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidString(string s) {
        int open=0; 
        int close=0; 
        int n=s.length();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(s[i]=='(' || s[i]=='*'){
                open++;
            }else{
                open--;
            }
            if(open<0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s[i]==')' || s[i]=='*'){
                close++;
            }else{
                close--;
            }
            if(close<0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
