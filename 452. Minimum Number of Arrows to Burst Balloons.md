# Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all the balloons. One key insight is realizing that we need to identify overlapping intervals and shoot the arrows such that they burst all overlapping balloons simultaneously.

# Approach
1. Sort the intervals based on their start points.
2. Initialize a count variable to keep track of the arrows needed, starting with 1.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals.
4. For each interval, if its start point is less than or equal to the end point of the previous interval, update the end point of the previous interval to be the minimum of the current interval's end point and the previous interval's end point.
5. If the current interval's start point is greater than the previous interval's end point, it means a new arrow is needed, so increment the count.
6. Return the final count, which represents the minimum number of arrows needed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting of intervals.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(),points.end());
        int len=points.size();
        int count=1;
        for(int i=1;i<len;i++){
            if(points[i][0]<=points[i-1][1]){
                points[i][1]=min(points[i][1],points[i-1][1]);
            }
            else count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
