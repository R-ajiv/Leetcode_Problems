# Intuition
To reverse a linked list, we can iterate through the list while keeping track of the previous, current, and next nodes. We will reverse the direction of pointers to point from the current node to the previous node instead of the next node.

# Approach
1. Initialize three pointers: prev, current, and next.
2. Iterate through the linked list.
3. Inside the loop, update the next pointer to store the next node.
4. Reverse the direction of the current node's pointer to point to the previous node.
5. Move prev, current, and next pointers one step forward.
6. Repeat until the current node becomes null.
7. Return the prev pointer which now points to the new head of the reversed list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the entire linked list once.
- Space complexity: O(1) - We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode next = null;

        while(current != null) {
            next = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
