# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Intuition
My first thought when approaching this problem was to iterate through the prices array and keep track of the minimum buy price and the maximum profit that can be obtained. 

## Approach
I iterate through the prices array, keeping track of the minimum buy price (`buy`) and updating the maximum profit (`maxProfit`) whenever a higher selling price is encountered. The idea is to find the best time to buy and sell to maximize the profit.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the prices array once, performing constant time operations in each iteration.

- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables (`buy` and `maxProfit`), regardless of the input size.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
       int x = prices.length;
        int buy = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < x; i++)
        {
            if (prices[i] < buy) buy = prices[i];
            else
            {
                if (prices[i] - buy > maxProfit) maxProfit = prices[i] - buy;
            }
        }
        return maxProfit; 
    }
}
