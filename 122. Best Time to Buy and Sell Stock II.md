# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Intuition
My initial thought was to iterate through the given array of stock prices and identify the ascending sequences. The idea is to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point during each ascending sequence.

## Approach
I used a simple approach that involves iterating through the prices array. I maintained two variables, `minimum` and `maximum`, to track the lowest price encountered and the cumulative profit, respectively. Whenever a price lower than the current `minimum` was found, I updated `minimum`. If a price higher than the current `minimum` was found, I calculated the profit by selling at the current price and buying at the `minimum`. The `maximum` was updated accordingly.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) 
  - The algorithm iterates through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables are maintained regardless of the input size.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minimum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maximum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length ; i++){
            if(minimum > prices[i]) {
                minimum = prices[i];
            } else if (minimum < prices[i]) {
                maximum = maximum + prices[i] - minimum ;
                minimum = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maximum;   
    }
}
