# Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends

## Intuition
My first thought to solve this problem is to use a two-pointer approach. Starting from both ends of the string, I can compare characters at the pointers. If they are the same, I can keep moving the pointers towards the center while those characters are equal. If they are different, I stop and return the length of the remaining substring between the pointers.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, pointing to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
2. While `i` is less than `j`, compare characters at positions `i` and `j`.
3. If they are equal, move both pointers towards the center, skipping all consecutive equal characters.
4. If they are different, return the length of the remaining substring between `i` and `j`.
5. If the loop completes and `i` is equal to `j`, return 1, otherwise return 0.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using constant space.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                char ch = s[i];
                while (i < s.size() && s[i] == ch) i++;
                while (j >= 0 && s[j] == ch) j--;
            } else {
                return (j - i + 1);
            }
        }
        return (j - i == 0) ? 1 : 0;
    }
};
