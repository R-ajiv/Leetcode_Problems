# Intuition
We are given a set of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start times, and a new interval to be inserted into the intervals. Our goal is to merge the new interval with the existing intervals if there's any overlap or add it as a separate interval if there's no overlap. 

# Approach
We can solve this problem by first adding the new interval to the list of intervals, then sorting them based on their start times. After that, we iterate through the intervals and merge or add intervals as needed. We maintain a result vector to store the merged intervals.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals. Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and then we iterate through the intervals once, which takes O(n) time.
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing the result vector.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
        // Add the new interval to the list of intervals
        intervals.push_back(newInterval);
        // Sort the intervals based on their start times
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        
        // Initialize a vector to store the merged intervals
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        // Add the first interval to the result vector
        ans.push_back(intervals[0]);
        
        // Iterate through the intervals
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            int newl = intervals[i][0];
            int newr = intervals[i][1];
            int l = ans.back()[0];
            int r = ans.back()[1];
            
            // Merge intervals or add them separately based on conditions
            if(newl < l && newr < l) {
                ans.push_back({newl, newr});
            }
            else if(newl < l && newr == l) {
                ans.pop_back();
                ans.push_back({newl, r});
            }
            else if(newl >= l && newl < r && newr > l && newr <= r) {
                continue;
            }
            else if(newl <= r && newr > r) {
                ans.pop_back();
                ans.push_back({l, newr});
            }
            else if(newl > r && newr > r) {
                ans.push_back({newl, newr});
            }
            else {
                continue;
            }
        }
        // Return the merged intervals
        return ans;
    }
};
