# Middle of the Linked List

## Intuition
The task is to find the middle node of a given linked list. One intuitive way is to use two pointers - one moving twice as fast as the other. When the faster pointer reaches the end of the list, the slower pointer will be at the middle.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. Use a while loop to iterate through the list with `i` moving two steps at a time and `j` moving one step at a time.
3. Continue the loop until either `i` reaches the end of the list or `i.next` becomes null.
4. The position of `j` at this point will be the middle of the linked list.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only two pointers.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode i = head;
        ListNode j = head;

        while (i != null && i.next != null) {
            i = i.next.next;
            j = j.next;
        }
        return j;
    }
}
