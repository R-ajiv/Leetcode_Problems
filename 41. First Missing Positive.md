# Intuition
The problem asks us to find the first missing positive integer from an unsorted array of integers. We need to devise an algorithm to find this missing positive integer efficiently.

# Approach
1. We iterate through the array and try to place each positive integer in its correct position in the array. For example, the integer 1 should be at index 0, the integer 2 should be at index 1, and so on.
2. While iterating, if we encounter a positive integer that is within the range of the array and not already at its correct position, we swap it with the element at its correct position. We continue this process until we cannot perform any more swaps.
3. After rearranging the array, we iterate through it again to find the first missing positive integer. The first positive integer that is not in its correct position will be the first missing positive integer.
4. If all positive integers are in their correct positions, then the first missing positive integer is the next integer after the largest positive integer present in the array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the array twice, each iteration taking O(n) time.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses only constant extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Iterate through the array and place each positive integer in its correct position
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int x = nums[i]; 
            
            while (x >= 1 && x <= n && x != i + 1 && nums[x - 1] != x) {
                swap(nums[x - 1], nums[i]);
                x = nums[i];
            }
        }

        // Iterate through the array to find the first missing positive integer
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1)
                return i + 1;       
        }
        
        return n + 1; // If all positive integers are present, return the next integer
    }
};
