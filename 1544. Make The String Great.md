# Intuition
The problem asks to remove adjacent characters that are the same letter but different cases (e.g., 'a' and 'A', 'b' and 'B'). So, our intuition here is to use a stack data structure, which will help us keep track of characters in the string while ensuring that we only remove adjacent characters that meet the given condition.

# Approach
We will iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will check if the stack is not empty and the current character is equal to the top character of the stack ignoring the case (by comparing their ASCII values with a difference of 32). If they are equal, it means they are the same letter but different cases, so we pop the character from the stack. Otherwise, we push the current character onto the stack. At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the characters that form the "good" string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through each character of the string once.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. In the worst case, the stack could contain all characters of the input string.

# Code
class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) {
        string stack;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (!stack.empty() && abs(stack.back() - c) == 32) {
                stack.pop_back();
            } else {
                stack.push_back(c);
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
};
