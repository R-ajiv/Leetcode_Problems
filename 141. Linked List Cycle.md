# Intuition
My first thought to solve this problem is to use two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other. If there is a cycle in the linked list, these two pointers will eventually meet at some point. If there is no cycle, the faster pointer will reach the end of the list.

# Approach
I used two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list. The `i` pointer moves two steps at a time, while the `j` pointer moves one step at a time. If there is a cycle, the faster pointer (`i`) will eventually meet the slower pointer (`j`). If there is no cycle, the faster pointer will reach the end of the list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire list.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only two pointers regardless of the size of the linked list.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode i = head;
        ListNode j = head;
        while (i != null && i.next != null) {
            i = i.next.next;
            j = j.next;
            
            if (i == j)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
