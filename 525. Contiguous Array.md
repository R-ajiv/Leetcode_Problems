# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s. One intuitive approach is to keep track of the running count of 1s and 0s encountered so far. Whenever the difference between the counts seen before becomes the same again, it means that the subarray between these two points has an equal number of 1s and 0s.

# Approach
We maintain two variables, n1 (count of 1s) and n0 (count of 0s), initialized to 0. We also use an unordered map to store the difference between the counts and the corresponding index. Initially, we put (0, -1) into the map to handle the edge case where the first 0 appears. We iterate through the input array and update the counts of 1s and 0s. At each step, we check if the difference between the counts (n1 - n0) exists in the map. If it does, we update the length of the contiguous subarray if it's greater than the previous maximum length. If the difference is not in the map, we add it along with its current index. By doing this, we keep track of the indices where the count difference occurs.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the unordered map to store count differences and indices.

# Code
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), n1 = 0, n0 = 0, len = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        mp[0] = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            n1 += nums[i];
            n0 = (i + 1) - n1;
            if (mp.count(n1 - n0) != 0) 
                len = max(len, i - mp[n1 - n0]);
            else 
                mp[n1 - n0] = i;
        } 
        return len;  
    }
};
