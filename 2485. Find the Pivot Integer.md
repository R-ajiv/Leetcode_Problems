# Find the Pivot Integer


# Intuition
The problem requires finding the pivot integer, which is the number that divides an array of integers into two parts with equal sum on each side.

# Approach
We can calculate the total sum of integers from 1 to n using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Then, we iterate through the integers from 1 to n and keep track of the sum of elements encountered so far. At each step, we check if the sum of elements up to the current integer is equal to half of the total sum minus the current integer. If we find such an integer, it indicates that it is the pivot integer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the input integer.
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```java

class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        int sum=0;
        int psum=n*(n+1)/2;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            sum=sum+i;
            if(sum==psum-sum+i){
                return i;
            }
         } 
        return -1;
    }
}
