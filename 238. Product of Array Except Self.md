# Product of Array Except Self

# Intuition
To compute the product of array except self, we need to understand that for each element in the output array, it is the product of all elements to the left of it multiplied by all elements to the right of it. 

# Approach
We can compute the product of all elements to the left of each element and store it in an array. Then, we can compute the product of all elements to the right of each element and multiply it with the corresponding element from the left product array to get the final result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the additional array to store left products.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i,n=nums.size();
        vector<int>ans(n);

        int p=1;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            ans[i]=p;
            p=p*nums[i];
        }
        int s=1;
        for(i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            ans[i]=ans[i]*s;
            s=s*nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
