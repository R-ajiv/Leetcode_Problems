# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to efficiently count the number of subarrays where the maximum element appears at least k times.

# Approach
We start by finding the maximum element in the given array `nums`. Then, we use a sliding window approach to iterate through the array. We maintain two pointers `left` and `right` to define the current subarray. We also keep track of the count of occurrences of the maximum element within the current subarray.

While iterating through the array with the `right` pointer, we update the count of occurrences of the maximum element. If this count becomes equal to or greater than `k`, we move the `left` pointer to shrink the window, updating the count as we move. With each valid subarray found, we increment our answer by the number of subarrays possible with the current `right` pointer position, which is `(nums.size() - right)`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array `nums`. We traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long int max_num = *max_element(nums.begin(),nums.end()),count = 0;
        long long int left = 0,right = 0,ans = 0;
        while(right<nums.size()){
            if(nums[right] == max_num)count++;
            
            while(count>=k){
                if(nums[left]==max_num)count--;
                left++;
                ans += nums.size()-right;
            }    
            right++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
